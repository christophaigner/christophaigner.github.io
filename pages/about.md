# About
<br>
#### Hi there! 👋🏼

I'm Christoph, an Engineering Leader based in Vienna, Austria 🇦🇹

I've worked in several different industries including

* 📞 telecommunications
* 🤝 marketplaces
* 🩸 biotechnology
* 🎥 and more recently video streaming

at companies with less than 30 employees up to more than 8,000 employees.

I‘ve done both - building products from scratch & launching them and also enhancing established products with millions of users.

Starting from 2019, I’ve been leading both smaller and larger engineering teams through all stages from forming to performing and coached engineers & managers in their personal & professional development.

##### What I'm passionate about?
I ♥️ helping people unleash their potential and seeing how fast and how much they can grow with the right kind of mentorship and coaching.

I'm an avid reader and consider myself a lifelong student. 🙇🏻 📚

I've collected some of my favorite quotes [here]({{ site.url }}/quotes) and also wrote some [blog posts]({{ site.url }}/blog).
