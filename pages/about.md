# About
<br>
#### Hi there! 👋🏼

I'm **Christoph**, an Engineering Leader based in Vienna, Austria 🇦🇹

I've worked in several different industries including telecommunications 📞, marketplaces 🤝, biotechnology 🩸 and more recently video streaming 🎥 and for companies with less than 30 employees up to more than 8,000 employees.

Starting from 2019, I've been leading both smaller and bigger engineering teams and coached engineers in their personal & professional development.

##### What I'm passionate about?
I ♥️ helping people unleash their potential and seeing how fast and how much they can grow with the right kind of mentorship and coaching.

I'm an avid reader 📚 and consider myself a lifelong student 🙇🏻.

I've collected some of my favorite quotes [here]({{ site.url }}/quotes) and also wrote some [blog posts]({{ site.url }}/blog).
