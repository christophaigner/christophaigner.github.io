## Radical Candor

Radical Candor is {% include elements/highlight.html text="Caring Personally while Challenging Directly" %}.  
At its core, Radical Candor is guidance and feedback that’s both kind and clear, specific and sincere.

## Obnoxious Aggression

Obnoxious Aggression, also called brutal honesty or front stabbing, is what happens when you challenge someone directly, but {% include elements/highlight.html text="don’t show you care about them personally" %}. It’s praise that doesn’t feel sincere or criticism and feedback that isn’t delivered kindly.

## Ruinous Empathy

Ruinous Empathy is what happens when you want to spare someone’s short-term feelings, so you don’t tell them something they need to know. You Care Personally, but {% include elements/highlight.html text="fail to Challenge Directly" %}. It’s praise that isn’t specific enough to help the person understand what was good, or criticism that is sugar-coated and unclear. Or simply silence. Ruinous Empathy may feel nice or safe, but is ultimately unhelpful and even damaging. This is a feedback fail.

## Manipulative Insincerity

Manipulative Insincerity — backstabbing, political or passive-aggressive behavior — is what happens when you {% include elements/highlight.html text="neither Care Personally nor Challenge Directly" %}. It’s praise that is insincere, flattery to a person’s face and harsh criticism behind their back. Often it’s a self-protective reaction to Obnoxious Aggression. This is the worst kind of feedback fail.
