## Crucial Accountability

When we approach an accountability discussion, it's important to know that we must work on ourselves first. We can't go in determined to "fix everyone else" and expect to get the results we're really after. {% include elements/highlight.html text="We can only actually ever change ourselves." %}

### Choose What and If
> One of my problems is that I internalize everything. I can't express anger; I grow a tumor instead.
> 
> *- Woody Allen*

> Speak when you are angry and you will make the best speech you will ever regret.
> 
> *- Ambrose Bierce*


* **What.** Ask yourself what you really want. You can talk about the content, the pattern, or the relationship ({% include elements/highlight.html text="CPR" %}). Frequent and continued violations affect the other person's predictability and eventually harm respect and trust. To stay focused, ask what you really want.
* **If.** Are you talking yourself out of an accountability discussion? Don't let fear substitute for reason. Think carefully not just about the risks of having the conversation but also about the risks of not having it.

### Master My Stories
Instead of assuming the worst and then acting in ways that confirm your story, stop and **tell the rest of the story**. Ask: "Why would a reasonable person not do what he/she promised?" When you see the other person as a human being rather than a villain, you're ready to begin.

#### Fundamental Attribution Error
Most of the time human beings employ what is known as a {% include elements/highlight.html text="dispositional" %} rather than a {% include elements/highlight.html text="situational" %} view of others. We argue that people act the way they do because of uncontrollable personality factors (their disposition) as opposed to doing what they do because of forces in their environment (the situation).
We make this attribution error because when we look at others, we see their actions far more readily than we see the forces behind them.

### Describe the Gap
Make it safe by starting with the **facts** and **describing the gap** between what was expected and what was observed. Tentatively share your story only after you've shared your facts. 

People feel unsafe when they believe one of two things:

1. You don't respect them as human beings (you lack **mutual respect**).
2. You don't care about their goals (you lack **mutual purpose**).

End with a question to help diagnose.

### Make It Motivating and Easy
After you've paused to diagnose, listen for motivation and ability. Remember, you rarely need power. In fact, power puts you at risk. Instead, make it motivating and make it easy. **Natural consequences** are always present and always serve as a potential source of motivation.  
Explore the {% include elements/highlight.html text="six sources of influence" %} model, which is used to describe the potential root causes of all behavior.  

At the top of this model are two components of behavior selection. In order to take the required action, the person must be **willing and able**. Each of these components is affected by three **sources of influence**: **self, others, and things.**
There are typically multiple hidden forces at play. One example is social pressure - the mother of all stupidity.

### Stay Focused and Flexible
> I am a man of fixed and unbending principles, the first of which is to be flexible at all times.
> 
> *- Senator Everett Dirksen*


As other issues come up, don't meander; consciously choose whether to change the conversation to the new issue. Weigh the new infraction. If it's **more serious** or **time sensitive**, deal with it.
If it's not, don't get sidetracked.  

At the heart of every workable accountability system, there is one simple sentence: *"If something comes up, let me know as soon as you can."*

Use {% include elements/highlight.html text="AMPP" %} to power up your listening skills:
* **A**sk to get the conversation rolling.
* **M**irror to encourage. Hold up a mirror to people; that is describing the inconsistency between what they say and how they say it.
* **P**araphrase for understanding. Paraphrase; that is, put in your own words what you think they stated. Don't parrot. Restating exactly what they said can be annoying and sounds phony. It serves two functions: First, it shows that you are listening and that you care. Second, it helps you see what you do and don't understand.
* **P**rime to make it safe. Priming means adding words to the conversation (much like putting water in a pump to get it flowing), hoping the other person will do the same thing. You're trying to make it safe for them to share their thoughts.

### Agree on a Plan and Follow Up

> Never grow a wishbone ... where your backbone ought to be.
> 
> *- Clementine Paddleford*

> There are no exceptions to the rule that everybody likes to be an exception to the rule.
> 
> *- Charles Osgood*

Remember {% include elements/highlight.html text="WWWF" %}: **who** does **what** by **when** and then **follow up**. This idea is simple and serves as its own reminder. Then ask to make sure you're not leaving out any details or missing any possible barriers.
